# Subset_Files

This folder holds the generated **Subset** files after running the script **Generate_Subsets.m**

Generating these files requires preparing the necessary **Segment** and **Info** files.

Or, you can directly download the generated **Subset** files from this [GoogleDrive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1efP-WFYWx9DYLSQAXfHtT9tbZpFcXgGp?usp=sharing)
