These **Info** files are for generating the supplementary training, calibration, and testing **Subset** files with data from only the VitalDB database. 

Please prepare the **Info** files in this folder:

1. Download the following 5 **Info** files from
   * **VitalDB_Train_Info.mat**
   * **VitalDB_CalBased_Test_Info.mat**
   * **VitalDB_CalFree_Test_Info.mat**
   * **VitalDB_AAMI_Test_Info.mat**
   * **VitalDB_AAMI_Cal_Info.mat**
2. Move these files into this folder

Note: the **PulseDB_Info.mat** file provided is not required for generating the **Subset** files, but is helpful for analyzing the statistical information of the whole **PulseDB** dataset.
