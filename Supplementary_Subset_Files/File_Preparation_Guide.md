# Supplementary_Subset_Files

This folder holds the generated **Subset** files after running the **second block** of the script **Generate_Subsets.m**

Generating these files requires preparing the necessary **Segment** and **Info** files.

The generated **Subset** files are also available via [Kaggle](https://doi.org/10.34740/KAGGLE/DS/2447469).
